# TODO
- eo_arrays() and eo_all() crash if there is no referenced array
- Check whether scidb4geo runs in a cluster environment, maybe operators must be forced to run on the coordinator node or the postgres connection string must be adapted
- Implement eo_create, eo_resample, eo_reproject, eo_loadgdal, eo_insert
- Simplify compilation using scidb-dev packages
